## What's in the stack

-   Production-ready [SQLite Database](https://sqlite.org)
-   Unit testing with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) and [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com)
-   Code formatting with [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
-   Linting with [ESLint](https://eslint.org)
-   Static Types with [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org)

## Development

-   Start dev server:

    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

### Type Checking

This project uses TypeScript. It's recommended to get TypeScript set up for your editor to get a really great in-editor experience with type checking and auto-complete. To run type checking across the whole project, run `npm run typecheck`.

### Linting

This project uses ESLint for linting. That is configured in `.eslintrc.js`.

### Formatting

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for auto-formatting in this project. It's recommended to install an editor plugin (like the [VSCode Prettier plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)) to get auto-formatting on save. There's also a `npm run format` script you can run to format all files in the project.
